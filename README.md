### Hi, I'm Sonny 👋

I'm a coffee farmer. I grew up in [Daklak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Đắk_Lắk_Province), a small coffee-farming village, in Vietnam. I spend a lot of my young years with dogs and soils. 
- 🔭 I’m currently a PhD Candidate in Atmospheric Science at Monash University.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to adapt machine learning to tackle weather and climate problems.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on environmental issues.
- ⚡ Fun fact: Coffee farmer --> Environmental Engineer --> Atmospheric Scientist --> Coffee farmer?
- 📫 I'm best reached via [email](sonny.metvn@gmail.com)
